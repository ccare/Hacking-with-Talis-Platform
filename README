Some scripts from playing around with the Talis Platform...

==POSTCODE SEARCH==

Provide a postcode and get long/lat and northing/easting info

usage: postcode-location.rb 'CV4 7DG'

nb: if you don't provide a postcode it will default to the University of Warwick at CV4 7AL

==NEARBY POSTCODES==

Provide postcode (same as above) but list 10 nearby postcodes
